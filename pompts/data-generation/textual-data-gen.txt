"""
  I am creating input output training pairs to fine tune my gpt model. The usecase is a retailer generating a description for a product from a product catalogue. I want the input to be product name and category (to which the product belongs to) and output to be description.
  The format should be of the form:
  1.
  Input: product_name, category
  Output: description
  2.
  Input: product_name, category
  Output: description

  Do not add any extra characters around that formatting as it will make the output parsing break.
  Create as many training pairs as possible.

  I am creating input output training pairs to fine tune my gpt model. I want the input to be product name and category and output to be description. the category should be things like: mobile phones, shoes, headphones, laptop, electronic toothbrush, etc. and also more importantly the categories should come under 4 main topics: vehicle, clothing, toiletries, food)
  After the number of each example also state the topic area. The format should be of the form:
  1. topic_area
  Input: product_name, category
  Output: description

  Do not add any extra characters around that formatting as it will make the output parsing break.

  Here are some helpful examples so you get the style of output correct.

  1) clothing
  Input: "Shoe Name, Shoes"
  Output: "Experience unparalleled comfort. These shoes feature a blend of modern style and the traditional superior cushioning, perfect for those always on the move."
