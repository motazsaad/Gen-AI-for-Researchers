Create a CSV file with 10 rows of housing data.
Each row should include the following fields:
 - id (incrementing integer starting at 1)
 - house size (m^2)
 - house price
 - location
 - number of bedrooms

Make sure that the numbers make sense (i.e. more rooms is usually bigger size, more expensive locations increase price. more size is usually higher price etc. make sure all the numbers make sense). Also only respond with the CSV.

Create a Python program to generate 100 rows of housing data.
I want you to at the end of it output a pandas dataframe with 100 rows of data.
Each row should include the following fields:
 - id (incrementing integer starting at 1)
 - house size (m^2)
 - house price
 - location
 - number of bedrooms

Make sure that the numbers make sense (i.e. more rooms is usually bigger size, more expensive locations increase price. more size is usually higher price etc. make sure all the numbers make sense).

"""
Create a Python program to generate 3 different pandas dataframes.

1. Housing data
I want 100 rows. Each row should include the following fields:
 - id (incrementing integer starting at 1)
 - house size (m^2)
 - house price
 - location
 - number of bedrooms
 - house type
 + any relevant foreign keys

2. Location
Each row should include the following fields:
 - id (incrementing integer starting at 1)
 - country
 - city
 - population
 - area (m^2)
 + any relevant foreign keys

 3. House types
 - id (incrementing integer starting at 1)
 - house type
 - average house type price
 - number of houses
 + any relevant foreign keys

Make sure that the numbers make sense (i.e. more rooms is usually bigger size, more expensive locations increase price. more size is usually higher price etc. make sure all the numbers make sense).
Make sure that the dataframe generally follow common sense checks, e.g. the size of the dataframes make sense in comparison with one another.
Make sure the foreign keys match up and you can use previously generated dataframes when creating each consecutive dataframes.
You can use the previously generated dataframe to generate the next dataframe.
