# Prompt Engineering exercise step by step

Test a poor prompt to start with. Copy and paste the following text into your GenAI tool and note the results:
Tell me about the weather.

---

Now let’s try a prompt that includes more details relevant to the hypothetical help we need by copying and pasting the following text into your GenAI tool:
I am a teacher teaching grade 2 students about the weather. Please generate a lesson plan for a one-hour lesson about weather including a 30-minute activity to help students remember what they learned in the instruction portion of the lesson. Please provide sources.


---

Pick one or two topics that you know a lot about (e.g. What are the origins of skateboarding?).

Ask ChatGPT -or- Microsoft Copilot a question about one of the topics.
Is the answer accurate?
Can you make it more accurate with follow-up prompts?
Ask Copilot a question about your second topic.
How did it do for each topic?
Was it completely accurate?
Did you have to research to verify any of the claims Copilot made?

Set the Tone of the response you would like (e.g., formal, informal, humorous):
Poor: Weather in Paris.
Better: Give me a lighthearted weather update for Paris, France, with a humorous twist.
Use your own prompt now and experiment with varying the tone you request.


---

Incorporate examples or analogies to clarify complex concepts:
Poor: Explain cyclones.
Better: Explain how cyclones form, using the example of Cyclone Nisarga. Please provide sources.
Use your own prompt now and experiment with requesting the GenAI use an example or analogy.

---

Limit Scope to focus on a specific topic or task to prevent overly broad responses:
Poor: Tell me everything about weather.
Better: Provide an overview of the factors that influence the formation of thunderstorms.
Use your own prompt now and experiment with limiting the scope of your request.

--- 


Test and Iterate by experimenting with different variations of your prompt to see which yields the best results:
Initial: Weather in London.
Refined: What is the weather forecast for London, UK, for the upcoming weekend, including any weather warnings? Provide sources.
Use your own prompt now and experiment with iterating or refining your request.

---


Prompt Chaining by using the output of one prompt as the input for another to build on responses or refine results (much like a conversation):
First Prompt: What are the key factors that affect local weather conditions?
Second Prompt (following the first response): Considering those factors, what is the likely weather forecast for San Francisco next week? Provide sources.
Use your own prompt now and experiment with prompt chaining.

Leverage Precedents by incorporating elements of successful prompts you’ve used in the past:
A GenAI created picture of a student learning about the weather
Previous Successful Prompt: Explain the concept of EL NIÑO and its impact on global weather patterns.
New Prompt (leveraging precedent): Explain the concept of LA NIÑA and its impact on global weather patterns. Provide sources.

Assign a role to the GenAI to the tool in order to provide additional context for the result: You are the head of a creative department for a leading advertising agency...

Create an Image in Copilot (the free version of Perplexity.ai does not allow you to generate images). The image to the right was created by Copilot using the prompt below. Be sure to take a close look at the child’s left hand, and notice the extra finger that Copilot has accidentally included. GenAI image generators will sometimes do weird things. (Note: The free version ChatGPT (3.5) as of March 2024 does not allow users to generate images):
Successful prompt: Create an image of a grade 2 student learning about the weather.
Use your own prompt now and experiment with creating your own images.

## More Advanced Prompt

Let’s use the topic of Global Warming to practice using some advanced prompt design techniques. Type or copy and paste the prompts below into your GenAI tool and then let’s look at the results:
Initial prompt:
What is global warming and what are its causes? Provide sources.
Scope:
Limit the text to 300 words in the language that a grade 4 student can understand.
Tone:
Reword it using the humorous tone and language of a Dr. Seuss book.
Image generation:
Create an image of a grade 4 student learning about the global warming.
A GenAI created picture of a student learning about the global warming
Image modification:
Have the image use the look and feel of drawings from a Dr. Seuss book.
Start a “New topic” by pressing the blue button on the bottom left of the screen, and then paste in the following text and press enter:
I am a teacher teaching grade 4 students about the weather. Please generate a lesson plan for a one-hour lesson about weather including a 30-minute activity to help students remember what they learned in the instruction portion of the lesson.
Now look through the lesson plan and look at the “Activity” section. Let’s ask Copilot to give us more details by asking the following:
Please provide additional and detailed step-by-step student instructions for the activity portion of the lesson plan.
Reflection time:
How useful is the lesson plan your GenAI tool created?
Do you have enough background knowledge in global warming and teaching to critically evaluate the quality of your GenAI tool’s response?
How useful are the detailed activity instructions that your GenAI tool created?
Do you know enough to evaluate them? If not where would you find information to help you critically evaluate them?

## Idea Generation

I am an undergraduate student getting ready to start an honours research project. I am interested in university-level academic makerspaces. What are some topics of inquiry that might be interesting for me to research or explore on this topic?

--- 


Suggest 5 research questions for the following topic: Evaluate the effectiveness of makerspace programs. What assessment methods can be used to measure learning outcomes? How can we assess the impact of makerspaces on students’ employability?
